0.3.0
=====
New Features:
- Complete port/rewrite to Vala, Scratchpad now runs (flys) natively!
- Tag-based replace mechanism.
- Use GUniqueApp for single instance behaviour, so startup notification
  and focus stealing should work better now.
  
Removed Features:
- No more GnomeVFS, waiting for GVFS!
- Revisions. Wasn't happy with them, to be reconsidered.
- Autosave and save options. Now defaults to save on focus out (saving
  your laptop batteries).
- Tools menu.
  
Bugfixes: 
- It's practically a rewrite, so all bugs should be brand new!
- Icon sucks less.

Known Problems:
- Font changes won't take effect immediately.
